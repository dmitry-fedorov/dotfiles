# Usage:

#   auctionet_icon â˜•

# Generates an Auctionet icon with the given emoji, suitable as a Slack workspace icon.
# (Not suitable for public-facing use since Apple emojis likely aren't free to use.)
#
# I started with this funky Cloudinary setup mostly for fun, but found that rendering Apple emoji is tricky in e.g. RMagick, too, so might as well stick with this ðŸ¤·
